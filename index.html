        <h3>10 Things You Didn’t Know About Albert Einstein:</h3>

                He never failed math. This is a popular “fact” promoted on the
                internet, maybe in an attempt to relate to genius. However, it
                is simply not true. Overall, Einstein was an average student,
                but math was one area where he excelled, unsurprisingly.

                Einstein encouraged the development of the nuclear bomb. His
                involvement is often misinterpreted, with some claiming that he
                helped create the atom bomb. In reality, what he did was write a
                letter to President FDR encouraging him to begin work on such a
                weapon, which led to the Manhattan Project. Although a dedicated
                pacifist and, later, an anti-nuke spokesman, Einstein was
                convinced that America needed the atomic bomb before the Nazis.

                He was a great musician. If the whole “genius” thing didn’t work
                out, Einstein could have become a violinist. His mother played
                piano so he had the love of music instilled in him—via violin
                lessons—at the young age of five.

                He could have been the President of Israel. When Israel’s first
                president, Chaim Weizmann, died, Einstein was offered the
                position, but he declined.

                He married his cousin. After Einstein divorced his first wife,
                Mileva Maric, he married his cousin, Elsa Lowenthal. He was,
                actually, quite a bad husband to his first wife in their later
                years. He had affairs he never tried to hide, he moved the
                entire family to Berlin without discussion, and treated her more
                as a servant than a wife.

                He won the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics. This alone isn’t
                particularly surprising. What is surprising is the fact that he
                didn’t receive it for the general or special theory of
                relativity, but rather for the photoelectric effect.

                He loved to sail. Ever since university, Einstein sailed as a
                hobby. But by his own admission, he never made a particularly
                good sailor. In fact, he didn’t even know how to swim. He really
                didn’t like socks, and usually didn’t wear them. In fact, in a
                letter to Elsa, he bragged about getting away “without wearing
                socks” while at Oxford.

                His brain was stolen. After Einstein died, the pathologist who
                did his autopsy took his brain without permission. He eventually
                got the permission necessary from Einstein’s son, but he was
                fired from Princeton when he refused to turn the brain over. He
                kept it for over forty years before finally returning it in
                1998.
